# Model analysis project

Our project is titled Solow model with economical damage from climate change and is about the famous model by Robert Solow, which attempts to describe economic growth in the framework of capital accumulation. The aim of the project is to analyze the classic solow model and introduce a variable that describe climate change to illustrate the difference between the more classic Solow compared to a more modern approach. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
