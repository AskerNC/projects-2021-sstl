# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **School performance across Danish Municipalities** and is about how students in primary school perform in the context of their gpa across different municipalities in Denmark .

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades two datasets**:

1. INDKP101.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/INDKP101
1. RAS200.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/RAS200

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
