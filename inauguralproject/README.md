# Inaugural project

Hello and welcomme to our Inaugural project. This project follows the structure initiated by its original creators. The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb). It's clear that the nature of our results is based on the scipy module and its optimize function. Other perspectives can be used to yield the same results, but we have tried to keep it consistent throughout the project. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
